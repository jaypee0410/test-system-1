# test-system-1
The test-system-1 folder is a comprehensive testing suite designed to validate the functionality and performance of our software application. It contains various test cases that cover both unit and integration tests to ensure every component works as expected. Each test script is organized into subfolders based on the module it targets, making it easy to locate and run specific tests. The tests are automated using popular frameworks like Jest and Mocha, providing a reliable and repeatable testing process. Detailed instructions on how to set up and execute the tests are included in the README file within this folder. The test results are output to a designated directory for easy review and analysis. Continuous integration support is configured to automatically run these tests with every commit, ensuring early detection of issues. Environment setup scripts are also provided to replicate the production environment locally. This robust testing system helps maintain code quality and stability throughout the development lifecycle. Contributions and updates to the test cases are welcome to keep the suite current and comprehensive.
